		<strong> Do not use a password you use for other websites.</strong> Your password is stored in the DB as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA256 hash</a>, and it is still passed to the server over a secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> connection, but the next line of defense is for you, the user, to never use synchronized passwords.
